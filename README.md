# reasier ( make you read easier )
side project.
It's very common to use vim to read some codebase. And it's also very common that when I use vim I'm thinking what if vim can do blablabla then that's would be wonderful.
So I tried to implement all those functionalities what I want to have when I use vim to read source code.
